# Number Plate Detector Using Image Processing In MATLAB
The aim of this project is to detect the number plate of a vehicle and provide an image of region of interest. The project uses MATLAB R2015a in order to edit and compile the program. The built-in Image Processing Toolbox is used for the purpose.  The program is useful to detect front as well as rear number plates, and is immune to variations in lighting conditions. Apart from those directly oriented, it can also detect number plates that are inclined to the camera by 15 to 30 degrees.
